# ML For Classification Problem

To cover everything in building a ML model for classification problem

## Data
Understand data & business need

## EDA
Exploring data with chart like boxplot, histogram

## Data Preprocessing
Doing data preprocessing in the right order will speed up the process by minimizing errors.
* one-hot-encoding / dummy variables
* train-test split
* data cleaning incl. duplicates and outliers
* missing values and imputation
* feature scaling & transformation: standardization
* deal with imbalanced class: resample with SMOTE
* feature selection: RFE and embedded method


## Modeling
There are several machine algorithms can be chosen to solve a classification problem. Then which one is the "best"?
* model comparison
* model optimisation: tuning hyperparameter
* evaluate the optimised model


## Save output
Itâ€™s important to be able to develop a model with good re-usability, so save the predictions and the model.
